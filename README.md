# A brave new world

I am a brilliant guy with a lot of focus problems. I am cappable of do many projects in my head, and forget them before I do any. 

This will be a big challenge for me, to be able to program every single day until I am good enough. I know programmers lifes are quite hard, since they solve problems others do (or they do as well).

Oh shit... here we go again.
